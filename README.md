# ETW2001 Assignment Problem Statement 


The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is constantly evolving. In order to stay ahead of the competition, video game publishers need to be able to make informed decisions about which games to develop, how to market them, and where to release them. The video game sales dataset can be used to help video game publishers make these decisions.

The video game sales dataset contains information on the game's title, platform, release date, genre, publisher, and sales in North America, Europe, and Japan. The dataset includes data for video games released from 1985 to 2022.

The video game sales dataset can be used to analyze trends in video game sales over time. For example, the dataset can be used to identify which genres are becoming more popular, which platforms are becoming more popular, and which countries are becoming more important markets for video games. This information can then be used to help video game publishers make decisions about which games to develop, how to market them, and where to release them.

The video game sales dataset can also be used to compare the sales of different video games. For example, the dataset can be used to identify which games have been the most successful, which games have been the most profitable, and which games have been the most critically acclaimed. This information can then be used to help video game publishers make decisions about which games to develop, how to market them, and where to release them.

The video game sales dataset can also be used to identify the most successful video game publishers. For example, the dataset can be used to identify which publishers have released the most successful games, which publishers have made the most money, and which publishers have received the most critical acclaim. This information can then be used to help video game publishers make decisions about how to compete in the industry.

Here are some specific examples of how the video game sales dataset can be used to help video game publishers make informed decisions:

A video game publisher could use the dataset to identify which genres are the most popular in a particular country or region. This information could then be used to help the publisher decide which games to develop for that market.
The dataset could also be used to identify which platforms are the most popular in a particular country or region. This information could then be used to help the publisher decide which platforms to release their games on.
The dataset could also be used to identify which factors are most important for determining the success of a video game. This information could then be used to help the publisher make decisions about how to develop, market, and release their games.
